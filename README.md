# Flex CLI

A command-line interface for [Sharetribe
Flex](https://www.sharetribe.com/flex/). Flex CLI enables you to

your marketplaces.

To use Flex CLI, you will need a marketplace and an admin user API
key. You can request a marketplace from
[www.sharetribe.com/flex](https://www.sharetribe.com/flex/) to get
credentials to Console where you can generate new API keys in the
Build section.
